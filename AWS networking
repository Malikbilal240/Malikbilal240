AWS Networking Made Easy
Think of AWS networking like setting up rooms and hallways in a building, where you control who can enter, leave, and talk to each other.

1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) — Your Private Building

What is it?
Your own private space in AWS where you put all your resources (like servers, databases).
Example:
Imagine renting a floor in an office building. Only you and your team can use it.


2. Subnets — Rooms in Your Building

What is it?
Smaller sections (rooms) inside your VPC for organizing resources.
Example:
One room (subnet) is open to visitors (public), another is for employees only (private).


3. Internet Gateway — The Main Door

What is it?
The door that lets your resources talk to the internet.
Example:
You install a front door so people (internet users) can visit your reception area (public subnet).


4. Security Groups — Security Guards

What is it?
Rules that decide who can enter or leave each room (resource).
Example:
You tell the security guard at the door: "Only people with badges can enter the server room."


5. Route Table — Hallway Directions

What is it?
A map that tells traffic where to go inside your building.
Example:
Signs in the hallway: "Reception this way, Server Room that way."


6. VPC Peering — Connecting Two Buildings

What is it?
A private hallway between two VPCs so they can talk to each other.
Example:
You build a bridge between your building and your partner’s building so teams can collaborate.


7. Direct Connect — Private Tunnel

What is it?
A dedicated, private connection from your office to AWS (not over the public internet).
Example:
You build a private tunnel from your company’s data center straight into your AWS building.


Simple Example Scenario
Let’s say you want to run a website on AWS:

Create a VPC (your building).
Make two subnets:

Public subnet (for your web server, so people can visit your site).
Private subnet (for your database, so only your web server can talk to it).


Add an Internet Gateway (so the web server can be reached from the internet).
Set up Security Groups:

Allow web traffic (port 80/443) to the web server.
Only allow the web server to talk to the database.


Launch your resources (web server in the public subnet, database in the private subnet).
