Python Basics Simplified
Detailed Key Points of Python

Hereâ€™s a deeper look at the essential concepts and features that define Python, explained in a clear and structured way:

    ---

1. Variables and Data Types
    - Variables: Containers for storing data values. No need to declare the type.
```python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
```
    - Dynamic Typing: Variable types can change at runtime.
```python
x = 5
x = "now a string"
```
    - Common Data Types:
    - `int`: Integer numbers (`5`, `-10`)
    - `float`: Decimal numbers (`3.14`)
    - `str`: Strings/text (`"hello"`)
    - `bool`: Boolean values (`True`, `False`)
    - `list`: Ordered, mutable collection (`[1, 2, 3]`)
    - `tuple`: Ordered, immutable collection (`(1, 2, 3)`)
    - `dict`: Key-value pairs (`{"name": "Alice"}`)
    - `set`: Unordered, unique items (`{1, 2, 3}`)

    ---

2. Operators
    - Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (integer division), `%` (modulus), `**` (power)
    - Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    - Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
    - Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

    ---

3. Control Flow
    - Conditional Statements: Direct the flow based on conditions.
```python
if x > 0:
print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
print("Zero")
else:
print("Negative")
```
    - Loops:
    - for loop: Iterate over a sequence (like a list or range).
```python
for i in range(5):
print(i)
```
    - while loop: Repeat as long as a condition is true.
```python
while x > 0:
print(x)
x -= 1
```
    - break and continue: Exit or skip to the next iteration in loops.

    ---

4. Functions
    - Definition: Use `def` keyword.
```python
def add(a, b):
return a + b
```
    - Arguments and Return Values: Functions can take parameters and return results.
    - Default Arguments: Provide default values for parameters.
```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
print("Hello,", name)
```
    - Lambda Functions: Small anonymous functions.
```python
square = lambda x: x * x
```

    ---

5. Data Structures
    - List: Mutable, ordered collection.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
    - Tuple: Immutable, ordered collection.
```python
coords = (10, 20)
```
    - Dictionary: Key-value pairs.
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```
    - Set: Unordered collection of unique elements.
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
```

    ---

6. String Handling
    - Strings are immutable.
    - Support for slicing and formatting.
```python
text = "Hello, World!"
print(text[0:5])  # Output: Hello
print(f"Name: {name}")
```

    ---

7. Input and Output
    - Input: `input()` function reads user input as a string.
    - Output: `print()` displays information.

    ---

8. Modules and Packages
    - Modules: Files containing Python code (functions, variables, classes).
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
```
    - Packages: Collections of modules in directories with `__init__.py` file.

    ---

9. Exception Handling
    - Handle errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `finally`.
```python
try:
result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
print("Done.")
```

    ---

10. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Classes and Objects: Define custom data types.
```python
class Dog:
def __init__(self, name):
self.name = name
def bark(self):
print(self.name + " says woof!")
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.bark()
```
    - Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism: Core OOP principles.

    ---

11. Indentation
    - Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks instead of braces `{}`.
    - Consistent indentation is crucial.

    ---

12. Comments and Documentation
    - Single-line comment: `#`
    - Multi-line comment/docstring: Triple quotes `""" ... """`

    ---

13. Popular Libraries
    - NumPy: Numerical computations
    - Pandas: Data analysis
    - Matplotlib: Plotting/visualization
    - Requests: HTTP requests
    - Django/Flask: Web development

    ---

14. Pythonic Practices
    - Write clean, readable code.
    - Follow PEP 8 style guide.
    - Use list comprehensions for concise loops.
```python
squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]
```
