Prepare: It all started with solid preparation. The group built a time line for three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress 
to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they need to achive the successful 
result they identified in the previous  step, in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from a servey of new employees. They identified 
specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processed
1. Ask
Ask effective questions, define the problem, use structured thinking, communicate with others
2. Prepare
understand how data is generated and collected, identify and use different data formats, types and structures
make sure data is unbaised and credible, organize and protect data
3. Process
create and transform data, mantain data integrity, test data, clean data,verify and report on cleaning results
4. Analyze 
use tools to format and transform data, sort and filter data, identify patterns and draw conclusions, make predictions and 
recomendations, make data driven decisions
4. Share
understand visualization, create effective visuals, bring data to life, use data storytelling, communicate to
 help others to understand results
5. Act
apply your insights, solve problems, make decisions, create something new
Analytical skills 
qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts below are the five essiential points for data analytical
skills 
1. curiosity
Curisoity is what drives us to explore, learn and discover new thigs! it's is that
 spark that makes us ask questions, seek answers, and grow!
 2. Understand context(context is the condition in which something exists or happens)means graping the situation, surroundings or 
 background
 
 3. Having technical mindset. Is the ability to break things down into smaller steps and work with them with an orderly

Analytical thinking
Identifying and defining any problem then solving it using data in an organized and step by step matter.
Key aspects of analytical thinking
1. Visualization(The graphical representation of information)
2. Stratgy (being stratgic when interacting huge amount of data to stay focused on solving problem)
