=====

1) Creating Users:

create user test1 identified by test1;
grant connect to test1;

create user test2 identified by test2;
grant connect to test2;

create user test3 identified by test3;
grant connect to test3;

--- create user test identified by test default tablesapce user;
--- grant dba to test;
--- CREATE USER odb PROFILE "DEFAULT" IDENTIFIED BY ODB DEFAULT TABLESPACE "USERS" TEMPORARY TABLESPACE "TEMP01" QUOTA UNLIMITED ON "USERS" ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
--- CREATE USER odb PROFILE "DEFAULT" IDENTIFIED BY ODB DEFAULT TABLESPACE "USERS" TEMPORARY TABLESPACE "TEMP" QUOTA UNLIMITED ON "USERS" ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

2) Password reset / user exists or not:
select username, account_status from dba_users where username='test2';
USERNAME                       ACCOUNT_STATUS
------------------------------ --------------------------------
test2                          EXPIRED

alter user test2 identified by Welcome2020;

Assign Unlimited quota to user:
alter user odb quota unlimited on users;

Drop database user:
drop user odb cascade;

3) Roles:
--- SELECT * FROM dba_role_privs WHERE grantee IN ('OBIA_DRM');
--- select privilege from dba_sys_privs where grantee = 'RESOURCE';
--- select privilege from dba_sys_privs where grantee = 'CONNECT';

CREATE ROLE TEST_ROLE;

CREATE ROLE TEST_ROLE2 IDENTIFIED BY TEST_ROLE2;

SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLES where role='TEST_ROLE2';

GRANT create, select, insert, update, delete ON HR.EMPLOYEES TO TEST_ROLE2;
GRANT  select, insert, update, delete ON HR.EMPLOYEES TO TEST_ROLE;

grant TEST_ROLE to TEST1;
grant TEST_ROLE to TEST2;

conn TEST1/test1
select count(*) from HR.EMPLOYEES;

conn TEST2/test2
select count(*) from HR.EMPLOYEES;

conn TEST3/test3
select count(*) from HR.EMPLOYEES;

4) Profiles

SELECT username, profile FROM dba_users;

SELECT * FROM dba_profiles WHERE PROFILE = 'DEFAULT' ORDER BY resource_type, resource_name;


CREATE PROFILE TEST_USERS LIMIT 
SESSIONS_PER_USER          UNLIMITED
CPU_PER_SESSION            UNLIMITED 
CPU_PER_CALL               3000 
CONNECT_TIME               15;

CREATE USER test4 IDENTIFIED BY test4 PROFILE TEST_USERS;

SELECT username, profile FROM dba_users WHERE username like 'TEST%';


5) QUOTA:

Assign Unlimited quota to user:

SELECT * FROM user_ts_quotas;

alter user odb quota unlimited on users;

ALTER USER test1 QUOTA 10M ON users;
ALTER USER test2 QUOTA unlimited ON users;

grant create table to test1;

conn test1/test1;
create table T1(No number);
insert into T1(No) values(1);
insert into T1(No) values(2);
insert into T1(No) values(3);
insert into T1(No) values(4);

select * from T1;

SELECT * FROM user_ts_quotas;
