KEY POINTS OF ORACLE DB
PGA ##########################################
PGA is like your own little disk in memory where oracle puts all things you need while using the db
here are main things inside the PGA
sort area, session data, hash join area, cursors, stack
Sort area:
Temporary memory for sorting and ordering data during SQL queries.
Like: Pile of papers you’re sorting.
Session data:
Space for values and variables used only in your database session.
Like: Your notepad and sticky notes.
Hash join area:
Memory used to match data from two tables when joining them.
Like: A second pile where you’re matching customer files with orders.
Cursors:
Details about the SQL statements you have open and are working with.
Like: Bookmarks to jump back to different projects you have open.
Stack:
Memory for handling calculations and running your database code.
Like: Your calculator’s memory for quick math.
==============================
Scenarios when TEMP is used:##########################################
Large sorts (e.g., ORDER BY or GROUP BY on many rows)
Hash joins with huge data sets
Creating indexes on big tables
“Global temporary tables” when their data is larger than PGA can hold
Example:
You run a query that needs to sort 1 million rows, and PGA only fits 500,000.
Oracle sorts 500,000 in memory; the rest gets written to TEMP tablespace on disk, then merged at the end.
